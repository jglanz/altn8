## Summary ##

This plugin allows you to configure file mappings to enable simple switching between related files. For example from a Java Class to the related TestCase, html file, properties file, etc....

The mappings are configured using regular expressions to allow you to handle arbitrary complexity (see [Wiki](../../wiki)).  If there is more than one related file you are presented with a simple popup to select the correct file.

## Installation ##

Simply install latest release with IDEA's Plugin Manager.
